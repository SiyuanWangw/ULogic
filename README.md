This repository hosts the codes of our logic scaffolding inferential rule generation framework for primitive rule generation and rule composition, and the data of our generated inferential rule base ULogic. 

## Running the project
You can directly run `primitive_rule_pipeline.ipynb` script for primitive rule generation and `rule_composition.ipynb` for rule composition.

## Dataset
`Data/ulogic.json` provides all inferential rules generated by our framework while `Data/probing_subset.json` provides a high-quality author verified subset of ULogic for rule probing of LLMs.
Each rule is formatted as following:
 ```json
   {
     "context": "Your context here",
     "question": "Your question here",
     "answer": "Your answer here"
   }
   ```

## Demo
We provide a [demo](http://210.16.188.56:59998) for our inference engine.
