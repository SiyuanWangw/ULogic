# Can LLMs Reason with Rules? Logic Scaffolding for Stress-Testing and Improving LLMs [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11442)

![Illustration of Logic Scaffolding](assets/logical_scaffolding.png)

This repository hosts the codes of our logic scaffolding inferential rule generation framework for primitive rule generation and rule composition, and the data of our generated inferential rule base ULogic. 

## Running the project
You can directly run `primitive_rule_pipeline.ipynb` and `rule_composition.ipynb` respectively for primitive rule generation and rule composition in object interaction domain (for illustration). The functions (or step number and name) of each module in our scripts are commentted before each block.

Before running, you need to set your API key for openai. 

## Dataset
`Data/ulogic.json` provides all inferential rules generated by our framework while `Data/probing_subset.json` provides a high-quality author verified subset of ULogic for rule probing of LLMs.
Each rule is formatted as following:
 ```json
    {
    "s_rule": "CanObserve(Person X, Animal Y):- MoveTo(Person X, Region Z), Born(Animal Y, Region Z);",
    "v_rule": "If Person X moves to Region Z and Animal Y is born in Region Z, then Person X can observe Animal Y.",
    "domain": "accessibility",
    "depth": 0,
    "length": 2,
    "positive": true,
    "structure": "disjunctive",
    "label": true,
    "original_human_prediction": "2",
    "flipped_human_prediction": "1"
   }
   ```

## Demo
We provide a [demo](http://210.16.188.56:59998) for our inference engine.
