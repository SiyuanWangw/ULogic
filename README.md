# Can LLMs Reason with Rules? Logic Scaffolding for Stress-Testing and Improving LLMs [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11442)

This repository hosts the codes of our logic scaffolding inferential rule generation framework for primitive rule generation and rule composition, and the data of our generated inferential rule base ULogic. 

## Demo
We provide a [demo](http://210.16.188.56:59998) for our inference engine.
